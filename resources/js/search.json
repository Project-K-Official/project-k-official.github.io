You can still link to the page or share a link to the page. Retype would ensure no generated links or references to the hidden page are created. If on a public page, a link to a hidden page is made, the link will work and the hidden page will be visible.","The History component will continue to function as normal. Any hidden page visited would still be logged in the history, although that history is only available to the visitor.","Setting visibility: hidden on a page is a good way to create a draft or secret page that you do not want included in the navigation, but you still want to share a link to the page for others to view if they have the link.","Retype does not show you the link to this page, but it uses the same naming convention as all other pages is used.
